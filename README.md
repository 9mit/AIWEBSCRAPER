# AI Web Content Analyzer 

An interactive Python application that scrapes, cleans, and analyzes web page content, allowing users to ask questions directly about the page using Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash Large Language Model.

## Overview

This tool addresses the common challenge of extracting specific, meaningful information from dense or dynamic websites. Instead of manually sifting through content or relying on simple keyword searches, this application automates the process. A user provides a URL, the tool scrapes and cleans the relevant text, and then leverages a powerful AI model to answer natural language questions based *solely* on that page's content.

This project serves as a robust example of integrating web scraping, data cleaning, and Large Language Model APIs into a user-friendly, interactive system.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Dynamic Content Scraping:** Uses Selenium to load web pages, ensuring content rendered by JavaScript is captured.
*   **Intelligent Content Cleaning:** Employs BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and strip away noise (scripts, styles, navigation, ads, footers, etc.), focusing the AI on the core text.
*   **AI-Powered Q&A:** Leverages the large context window of Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to understand and answer questions based on the full text of a webpage.
*   **Context-Aware Analysis:** The AI is instructed to base its answers *strictly* on the provided text, preventing hallucinations or external knowledge from influencing the response.
*   **Interactive Chat Interface:** Built with Streamlit, the application supports conversational history, allowing for follow-up questions.
*   **Robust & User-Friendly:** Features clear user feedback, status updates, and comprehensive error handling for scraping and API interactions.
*   **Content Preview:** An expander allows users to view the cleaned text that is being sent to the AI for analysis.
